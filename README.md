Lizzie Walsh's final Interactive project for Coding the News course at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism. This interactive was created from publicly-available water tank inspection data and New York City's ArcGis map of known lead service lines. Lead service data was pulled from the map's feature layer using a Node.js. Data was analyzed, cleaned, and coded into the webpage using Python and Javascript.
